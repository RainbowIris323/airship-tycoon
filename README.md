# Airship Template Game
Use this repo as a starting point for your future Airship game!  

**Once opened in Unity, open scene "DefaultScene"**

You will need to setup the TypeScript Project before the game is playable. 

## Setting up the TypeScript Project
Note: you must open the project in Unity before building the Typescript.

Use Git Bash on PC, or Terminal on Mac:
First, `cd` into the TypeScript project directory.
```
cd Assets/Typescript~
```

Next, install node dependencies.
```
npm i
```

Now start the compiler in watch mode.
```
npm run watch
```
